# Project Guidelines

### Always work on granular tasks
1. **Granular Tasks**
   - Always complete granular taks which is testable
   - redeploy the code and verify the changes in Cursor Browser
   - Add tests around the added functionality and run
   - Do not unnecessary refactor unless necessary

2. **Understand the UI Flow**
   - Open the actual application UI in Cursor Browser
   - Manually perform the flow to understand current behavior
   - Inspect elements to verify xpaths are still valid
   - Check if UI has changed (new modals, different buttons, etc.)

3. **Confirm with User if Unclear**
   - If flow behavior is ambiguous, ask user for clarification
   - If multiple approaches possible, discuss before implementing
   - Don't assume - verify understanding of expected behavior

### While Fixing
4. **Make Minimum Changes**
   - Fix only what's broken, don't refactor unrelated code
   - Don't add features not requested
   - Keep changes focused and reviewable

5. **Reuse Existing Code**
   - Search codebase for similar keywords/functions before creating new ones
   - Use `grep` to find existing patterns
   - Extend existing keywords rather than duplicating logic

6. **Avoid Regression**
   - Don't modify other test cases unless explicitly asked
   - If changing shared keywords, verify they don't break other tests
   - Run related tests after changes to confirm no regression
